add a test:

a: "belongs to root"

b: "belongs to root"
    c:
        d: "belongs to c"
        e: "belongs to c"
        f:
            g: "belongs to f"
            h: "belongs to f"

    i:
        k: "belongs to i"


here we have a list of two keys a and b which belongs to same root element.
a has string value.
b is a map with keys c and i, both are maps.
c has keys d, e, f.
f has keys g and h.
i has key k.
